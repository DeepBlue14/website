            <p>
                Welcome to my website. As an undergraduate student at the
                University of Massachusetts Lowell, I have the opportunity
                to take COMP 91.64 GUI Programming I with Dr. Wenjin Zhou.
                This is my implementation of Assignment #4 for that class.
                Since my work in Dr. Holly Yanco's lab involves human-robot
                interaction, I am eager to learn how to design and develop
                elegant and intuitive client-side web-based applications.

                I am an undergraduate student at the <a href="http://www.uml.edu/">University of Massachusetts Lowell</a>
                in the Computer Science program.  I also serve as senior
                technical advisor for the robotics club.

            <h3>Robotics Laboratory</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently employed as an Undergraduate Researcher in Dr. Holly Yanco's <a href="http://robotics.cs.uml.edu/">Robotics Laboratory</a>
                at the UMass Lowell's Computer Science Department.  My work includes
                designing and implementing experimental software for robotic systems,
                assisting graduate students in running their experiments, and publishing papers.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work-related research includes tactical systems, user interfaces for
                assistive and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) robots, optics, and mobile systems.
                Many of these projects are developed using <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>,
                a meta-operating system for developing robotics applications, while some of our
                more portable software is developed on Android.

            <p>
                I played and composed classical piano for over 10 years.  Unfortunately,
                my work and school give me little time for such pursuits at the present.
                I also enjoy gardening and wood carving.
