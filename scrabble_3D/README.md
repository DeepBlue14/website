###**Project Synopsis**

This project is my implementation of the game Scrable, which is Assignment #9 for Dr. Wenjin Zhou's COMP 4610 GUI Programing I class.


###**Introduction**

This implementation of scrable explores the user of both 2D and 3D graphics libraries, as well as drag and drop functionality.


###**Dependencies**

This project uses the following libraries:
- jQuery
- jQuery-ui
- THREE.js


###**Build & Run**

Open a web browser.  We **highly recommend** you use Mozilla Firefox, since the THREE.js library has issues with some versions of Chrome.  Then go to: https://deepblue14.github.io/jKuczynskiA9_3D/index.html

The source code can be viewed at: https://github.com/DeepBlue14/jKuczynskiA9_3D


###**Future Work**

Since this is a home-work project, it will cease to be supported after 12/30/2016.  No future work is planned on this exact project--however, it has given us ideas for future projects.


###**Acknowledgments**

This work was supported in part by Dr. Wenjin Zhou. :womans_hat:
